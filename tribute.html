            <h2>The following list of rules he followed in his life:</h2>
        </center>
        <ul class="points">
            <li type="square">Change yourself.</li>

            <p> “You must be the change you want to see in the world.” “As human beings, our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world – that is the myth of the atomic age – as in being able to remake ourselves.”</p>
            <li type="square">You are in control.</li>
            <p>“Nobody can hurt me without my permission.” What you feel and how you react to something is always up to you. There may be a “normal” or a common way to react to different things. But that’s mostly just all it is.</p>
            <li type="square">Forgive and let it go.</li>
            <p>“An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching.” Without taking action very little will be done. However, taking action can be hard and difficult. There can be much inner resistance.</p>
            <li type="square">Take care of this moment.</li>
            <p>“I do not want to foresee the future. I am concerned with taking care of the present. God has given me no control over the moment following.” The best way that I have found to overcome the inner resistance that often stops us from taking action
                is to stay in the present as much as possible and to be accepting.</p>
            <li type="square">Everyone is human.</li>
            <p>“I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps.” “It is unwise to be too sure of one’s own wisdom. It is healthy to be
                reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err.”</p>
            <li type="square">Persist.</li>
            <p>“First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.”</p>
            <li type="square">See the good in people and help them.</li>
            <p>“I look only to the good qualities of men. Not being faultless myself, I won’t presume to probe into the faults of others.” “Man becomes great exactly in the degree in which he works for the welfare of his fellow-men.” “I suppose leadership
                at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting along with people.”</p>
